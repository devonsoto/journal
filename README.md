# EPL Journal App

The EPL Journal App is a dedicated platform for
English Premier League enthusiasts. After every
match your favorite team plays, jot down your
feelings, thoughts, and emotions. The cool part is
we analyze and
respond to questions about your past entries using
Open AI's chatgpt. We can learn how this season's EPL teams
are giving us a heart attack with those late
winners.
